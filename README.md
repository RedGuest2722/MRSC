Minecraft Railway Signalling Center (MRSC)

A Railway control and monitor.

PLANS:

- Main Display that shows everything
- sub areas
- junction control
- auto or manual mode


Main Display:
This will show active routes to and from signals over junctions

Sub Areas:
not to sure I will do this as it over complicate the project and the rails wont be as big

Junction Control:
This will allow interlocking over the junction

Auto or Manual mode:
If user wanted to they can take manual mode over the Signalling area either the whole line or the specific sub areas 


STARTUP:

all recievers need to have redstone active on green (which is the default)
the "signal" controller must have no redstone output
