Minecraft Railway Signalling Center (MRSC)

A Railway control and monitoring program.

PLANS:

- Main Display that shows everything
- sub areas (maybe)
- junction control
- auto or manual mode

Currently Availible:

- Automatic signals
- Repeater signals

- Interface for all signals.


Main Display:
This will show active routes to and from signals over junctions

Sub Areas:
not to sure I will do this as it may over complicate the project and the rail areas won't be as big

Junction Control:
This will allow interlocking across a junction

Auto or Manual mode:
If user wanted to they can take manual mode over the Signalling area either the whole line or the specific sub areas

STARTUP:
all recievers need to have redstone active on green (which is the default)
the "signal" controller must have no redstone output but be connect to signal from railcraft
